// The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

// Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag*.

const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
    </div>
  )


  // Change code above this line
}

// ie. self-closing in respect to the <div> the <p> element is placed inside - self-closing the parent container to <div /> will mean no content can be placed inside it, incl. the <p> one here
