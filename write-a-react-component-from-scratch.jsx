// Define a class MyComponent that extends React.Component. Its render method should return a div that contains an h1 tag with the text: My First React Component! in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.

// Render this component to the DOM using ReactDOM.render(). There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.

// Change code below this line

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));
