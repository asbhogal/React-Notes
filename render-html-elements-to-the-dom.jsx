// The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page. You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
// Change code below this line

ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('challenge-node'))

// The variable 'JSX' contains the HTML code to be passed to the 'challenge-node' element
